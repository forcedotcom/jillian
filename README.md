Jillian
=======
Jillian is a stand-alone Lua interpreter, with several blackberry-specific Lua add-ons.

Jillian was designed to assist in out-of-process UI automation, for
simulators or real devices connected to a network. It provides
functions to connect to the BlackBerry accessibilty framework, and
even injection, so that Lua scripts can read the and navigate the
BlackBerry screens.
